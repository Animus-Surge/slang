## The open source social media platform

What do most all other platforms have in common? They all are controlled by big companies with big say in the world. You never know what data they collect about you or your loved ones, and you can't even see what goes on under the hood. Slang is here to change that.

Whether you just want to see what goes on under the hood or you are a privacy fanatic, Slang can show you how everything works while being a fully functional social media platform.

## Security

Since this open source project is also a platform that intends to be the next big social media platform, a major concern will be security and access. Certain parts of the platform (i.e. the user authentication system) will be locked down and restricted from public view, but that is to maintain security. Functionality and algorithms will be available to view.

## The goal

Our goal is to create a social media platform that's as transparent as possible. Modern platforms with big companies around them have this secretivity around them to the point where you never know if you can trust them. That's not to say that they're all bad, but you just never know. By giving the public access to the source code and algorithms, we aim to lift the veils of what modern platforms simply do not show: the inner workings to their platforms.
