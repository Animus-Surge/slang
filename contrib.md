# Contributing to Slang

Have an idea for a feature? Found a bug and want to fix it yourself? Simply wish to get hands on with a social media platform? Well you're in the right place! There's a few rules to know about contributing to a project like this. Since security is a high concern, access to the production and staging databases (don't worry, your data is secure, developers will only have access to a limited part of the production database) is restricted to official developers. There is a test database that access can be granted to should it be required, though do note that priority will be given to patchers and fixers. See below for more information. (IMPORTANT: Databases have not been implemented yet as of October 2023)

## How to contribute without database access

There are plenty of ways to contribute without accessing the test database. The frontend is a great place to add new features, like themes, widgets, games, and more! The API layer between the front and backends is also a great place to contribute to that doesn't involve the database.

## Gaining access to the test database
